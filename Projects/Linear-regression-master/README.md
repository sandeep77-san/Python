# Linear-regression

Welcome to the 4 week Linear regression project on AIML Community. Linear regression is the most basic and often used Machine Learning algorithm in Data Science. Despite being the easiest one, it is ignored often times and not included in training the model, which is a regressive outlook. In this project, A to Z of Linear regression will be covered and a small project for prediction of housing price in King County, USA will be done using Linear Regression.

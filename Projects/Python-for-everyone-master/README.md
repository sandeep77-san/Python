# Python-for-everyone

Welcome to the 4-week module covering the basics of Python. We noticed that a lot of people come to the community and start doing Machine Learning projects without any exposure to coding. Others jump to Python from other languages like C, Java, etc. This course targets all and will act as the starting point to explore the amazing world of Python which is full of adventures and yes, Machine Learning!

We don't promise to everything but we will try to cover whatever is necessary to get you started in Python.
